# Web scraping using Python

This is a program that I make while learning Python for the first time. (using BeautifulSoup4)

The purpose of this program is to extract related content into data when a user enters a keyword they want on the web. (e.g. Excel)

This was made for educational purposes, not commercial purposes.
